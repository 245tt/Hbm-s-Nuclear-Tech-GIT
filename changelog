## Added
* Doors!
  * Your favorites from 1.12, the 7 remaining doors have finally been ported
  * Thanks to KoblizekXD for biting the bullet

## Changed
* Reduced the blast resistance of the large doors from absurdly high to still very but not quite as high
* Custom missiles are now launchable using the radar
* NTM's structures should no longer spawn in dimensions besides the overworld. Ores will still generate, assuming the config option is set.

## Fixed
* Fixed ancient bug where custom missiles launched using the launch table would not use the accuracy calculation and always be pin-point accurate
