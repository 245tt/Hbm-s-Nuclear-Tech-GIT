## Added
* Crystalline fullerite
  * A late-game crafting material that is currenly only used to make the FEnSU
  * Made from extracting fullerene from fine soot using high-performance solvent and a SILEX
* Arc welder
  * Similar to an assembler, but without templates
  * Can combine up to 3 items and one fluid
  * Recipes vary in duration and energy consumption, welding together osmiridium plates requires the output of powerful reactors
* Custom fluids
  * A config for adding custom fluid types
  * Sets basic stats, color and textures
  * Fluid tratis can be applied using the already existing fluid trait config
  * The fluid trait config has been renamed to prevent name clashes
  * Recommended greyscale textures recommended for the custom fluids are `custom_water`, `custom_lava`, `custom_oil` and `custom_toxin`
  * 256k tanks do not have a label for custom fluids, but the tank's color will match the fluid's tint
* Custom machine structure positioning anchor
  * Allows automatic generation of custom machine block configurations
  * Simply replace the controller of your custom machine mockup with the anchor, then link it to a custom machine structure output wand and select the two diagonal points
  * The resulting JSON structure will be saved in the config folder
* Welded plates
  * Made from welding together two cast plates in an arc welder
  * Now used in many progression-relevant machines, meaning that energy demand now more closely matches the energy production of progression-based generators
  * Many recipes have been adjusted to now use cast plates or welded plates

## Changed
* Schrabidium explosions now ignore all blocks at Y:0, not just bedrock. This means that bedrock ores and oil are spared
* Drone waypoint connections only show up if a drone or a logistic block is held

## Fixed
* Fixed RTG energy connectors being backwards
