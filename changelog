## Added
* Doors!
  * Your favorites from 1.12, the 7 remaining doors have finally been ported
  * Thanks to KoblizekXD for biting the bullet
* Rubber boat
  * Made from latex or synthetic rubber
  * A much less jankier alternative to the vanilla boat. Rotations are silky smooth and done via the strafe keys instead of based on the player's orientation
  * Won't break from ramming into blocks

## Changed
* Reduced the blast resistance of the large doors from absurdly high to still very but not quite as high
* Custom missiles are now launchable using the radar
* NTM's structures should no longer spawn in dimensions besides the overworld. Ores will still generate, assuming the config option is set.

## Fixed
* Fixed ancient bug where custom missiles launched using the launch table would not use the accuracy calculation and always be pin-point accurate
* Fixed RBMK heat exchangers being able to use heatable fluids that don't have heat exchanger efficiency defined like liquid sodium, heavy water and thorium salt
* Fixed RBMK heat exchangers not using the heat exchanger efficiency variable to determine cooling power
* Fixed the ballistic gauntlet spawning a client-side ghost bullet that doesn't move or despawn
* Fixed bug where different custom machine cores would merge in a stack when picked up, turning them into the same type
