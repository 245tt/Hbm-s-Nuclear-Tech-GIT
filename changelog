## Changed
* there is now a config option to disable the biome change caused by fallout. The config will also determine whether the biomes are registered at all, which prevents them from conflicting with other mods' biomes when disabled.

## Fixed
* Fixed trenchmaster armor not doing most of the armor calculation, making it the worst armor
* Fixed glowing mushrooms not being able to be bonemealed
* Fixed strand caster having one port that does not work with certain rotations
* Fixed fallout being able to replace bedrock
